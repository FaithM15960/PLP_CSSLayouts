# Power Learn Project - CSS Layouts & Responsive Web Design Assignment

## Overview
This project demonstrates modern CSS layout techniques, including **Flexbox** and **CSS Grid**, combined with **Responsive Web Design (RWD)** principles. The goal is to create a webpage that adapts seamlessly across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.

## Features
- **Flexbox Layout**:  
  - Used for the navigation menu and the content cards in the main section.  
  - Allows horizontal alignment and wrapping for responsiveness.

- **CSS Grid Layout**:  
  - Used for the overall page structure with two columns: main content and sidebar.  
  - Adjusts to a single-column layout on smaller screens using media queries.

- **Responsive Design**:  
  - Media queries adjust layout for tablets (`max-width: 900px`) and mobile (`max-width: 600px`).  
  - Navigation and content cards reflow for readability and usability on all devices.

- **Styling & Box Model**:  
  - Padding, margin, borders, and border-radius used to create visually distinct sections.  
  - Background colors highlight different content areas.

## File Structure
- `index.html`: Main HTML file with semantic structure and content sections.  
- `style.css`: External CSS file containing Flexbox, Grid, responsive styles, and visual design.

## How to Use
1. Open `index.html` in any web browser.  
2. Resize the browser window to see how the layout adapts to different screen sizes.  
3. Inspect elements to understand how Flexbox and Grid work together.
